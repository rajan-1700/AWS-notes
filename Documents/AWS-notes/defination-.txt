defination->
virtualization-> process of creating multiples vms , from a single physical hardware system , enabking more efficient resource use.

hypervisor-> software that crates and manages the vms

2 tyeps
hosted -- another os is setup on the host os(eg.window is my host os and i will be setting up the macos)
bare metal  --- another os is directly set up on the hardware.(no host os)

why virtualization->
chaeap, reduces workload, space, energy, easy backup using snapshot, easy recovery

cloud computing ->
1.on demand delivery of it resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.
2. accessgin the resources like databases , storga , software over the internet rather than owning and maintinng physical hardware.
3.simplest eg. google drive(accessing the storage over the internet).

cloud computing platforms->
1.aws
2.microsoft azure
3.gcp(google cloud platform)
4.ibm cloud
5.oracle
6.alibaba cloud
7.digital ocean
8.salesforce
9.vmware cloud
10.rackspace cloud
these companies having dedicated large servers , which they use to provide services to organizations.



types of cloud computing
1.iaas
2.paas
3.saas

Iaas->
IaaS → Rent IT infrastructure (servers, storage, network).
You manage → OS + Apps.
Provider manages → Hardware + Virtualization.
Examples → AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs.

Paas->
Full form → PaaS = Platform as a Service.
What you get → Infrastructure + OS + middleware + runtime + development tools.
What you manage → Only your applications and data.
What provider manages → Servers, storage, networking, virtualization, OS, runtime, updates.
Examples →
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Google App Engine
Heroku
Microsoft Azure App Services
Benefits:
Developers can focus only on coding.
No headache of patching OS or configuring servers.
Faster app development and deployment.


Saas->
Full form → SaaS = Software as a Service.
What you get → A complete, ready-made application.
What you manage → Usually nothing (sometimes just your data/settings).
What provider manages → Everything (infrastructure, OS, app, updates, security).
Examples →
Gmail, Google Drive
Microsoft Office 365
Zoom, Slack
Salesforce
Benefits:
No installation needed (runs on browser/app).
Always updated automatically.
Pay-as-you-go or subscription-based.
Accessible anywhere, anytime.

different types of cloud deployments:
public , private , hybrid cloud

public cloud-> a shared cloud enviorment where users can access services over the internet , like aws or azure.
private cloud-> a dedicated cloud enviorment for one org. offering more control and privacy
hybrid cloud-> A mix of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility.



few services provided by cloud prodivers
1.compute services
2.storage services
3.databse services
4.networking services
5.container services
6.serverless computing
7.machine learning services.
8.IAM(identity and access managment)
9.monitoring and logging
10.content deleivery newtwork
11.backup and disaster recovery

overview of aws:
1.aws offers a vast range of services, including compute power , storage solutions, networking , databases , and much more.
2.it offers pay as you go model , pay only for what you  have used , which is ideal for optimizing cost.
3.right now , aws provides around 200 services in different domains like AI, machine learning , computing power etc.

what makes aws so special->
scalability
global reach
relability
security

Most popular services provided by aws
ec2 for scalable computing
s3 for highly reliable storage.
rds for managed dbs.
lambda for serverless computing.

AWS IAM(Identity and access managment)
1.IAM is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
2.It allows you to manage users , roles, and permissions to define who can access what within your AWS enviorment.\
3.IAM is offered at no additional cost 
4.Global service
5.Root account created by default , should not be used or shared.
6.create users- who want access to aws resources
7.assign permissions.
8.create group
9.create roles
10.define policies- you can create and attach policies to define fine grained permissions for controlling access to aws resources. 
11.Manage federated access.(search and see)-extended access

MFA-multi factor authentication
is an extra layer of security that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification , like a password and a code from their phone , to access their account.
(username+ password+ security_code)


ways of accessing AWS resourcces
1.the AWS Mangament cnsole provides a graphical, web-based approach
2.the aws cli provides a command-line , scripting approach.
3.AWS SDKs and APIs offer programattic, code-based access, allowing users to integrate AWS directly into their applications.
